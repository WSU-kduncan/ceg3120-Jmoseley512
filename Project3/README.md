### Notes:

- At the top of the script where it says ```keyname:``` Do not attempt to put the SSH key to connect. That will be selected upon stack creation. 
- In the install of the packages for pip3. the package to install is python3-pip NOT pip3
- VSCode helps a ton with YAML editing, which can be weird otherwise
- I used Ubuntu 22.04 LTS over an exotic AMI to somplify deployment of the image. (```ami-08c40ec9ead489470 ```)
- I installed a YAML formatter from RedHat in VS code, it will red underline many lines, however they can be ignored and the CF template will still work.
- In many ways using the template is simpler than the graphical WebUI due to having eveything in one place over having to dig through a series of menus for what I need
